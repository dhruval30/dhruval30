Backend-tuned, ML-curious, and mildly obsessed with efficient code.  
Currently shipping ideas, breaking builds, and figuring out how to write Python that doesn't look like JavaScript.

## What I’m About

I like building things that don’t crash (often).  
If it scales, logs, and returns a `200`, I’m happy.  
Also very into turning cool ideas into side projects that eventually become real.

---

## Let's Connect

You build cool things? I build cool things.  
Let’s talk systems, side-projects, or why your LLM pipeline still outputs garbage JSON sometimes.

---

P.S. I write unit tests. Sometimes on purpose.
